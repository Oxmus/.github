# Oxmus   _Helping SMEs Harness the Power of AI_

We're lowering the barrier for SMEs to access the next generation of conversational AI and business process automation tools.

## üóø Our Logo

The Oxmus logo features Oxmus written in **Ogham (·öë·öå·öÜ·öê·öã)** , an ancient Celtic alphabet.

Ogham script consists of groups of strokes carved along or across a central line, traditionally found on standing stones throughout Ireland and parts of Britain. Each character represents a letter, with our logo spelling "OXMUS" in this ancient writing system.

## üìñ The Name "Oxmus"

**Oxmus** derives from the Latin "**oxus**" (sharp, keen, acute) combined with "**-mus**" (a suffix suggesting movement or process). The name embodies our core philosophy: **sharp intelligence in motion**.

### Etymology & Meaning

- **Oxus** (Latin): Sharp, pointed, keen-witted, acute
- **-mus** (Latin suffix): Indicating process, movement, or systematic action
- **Combined**: Sharp intelligence that drives systematic action and process automation

### Why This Name?

The name reflects our dual focus:

1. **Intelligence** - Our AI systems provide sharp, precise insights and decision-making capabilities
2. **Dynamic Action** - We don't just analyze; we automate and execute business processes

Just as our Ogham logo connects ancient wisdom with modern technology, "Oxmus" bridges classical language with contemporary innovation. The name suggests both the precision of thought and the momentum of execution that our platform delivers to businesses.

### Pronunciation
**OX-mus** /Àà…íks.m…ôs/ - rhymes with "proxy" + "mus"
